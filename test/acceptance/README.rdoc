= Cucumber Acceptance Tests

== Bootstapping Process

* run ./go in the acceptance directory and this will install everything you need and run the cucumber features
* uses jruby to execute cucumber as Celerity requires this

== Supported Browsers

* firefox, chrome, ie (windows)
* headless (celerity htmlunit with good javascript support)

== Syntax/API

* Uses Celerity and Watir-WebDriver that have almost the same API

== Style

* This uses a simple page-object pattern, where pages are defined as classes, and test data is defined in yaml files.
* The steps simply use the page classes to interact with the system.
