<h2>Important Information</h1>
	
<p>We have not vetted the people using our site to find housing, nor can we vouch for them.  It’s critical that you speak with them to determine whether it’s a good match and decide whether you feel comfortable housing them.</p>

<p>Your generosity in offering your home is commendable.  But we strongly urge you not to accept an arrangement that doesn’t feel right.  If you connect with an evacuee and you think for whatever reason it’s not a good match, tell them so.  If appropriate, you can encourage them to use our website or hotline to submit more requests.</p>
