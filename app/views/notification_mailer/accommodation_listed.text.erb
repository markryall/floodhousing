Dear <%= @salutation.titleize %>,

Thanks for volunteering to provide someone with a home in a time of
need. We've listed your offer on the OzFloodHelp.org site.

If you ever need to change, update or remove your listing, you can 
click the link below:

  <%# short_login_url(@accommodation) %><%= accommodation_url(@accommodation) %>

You will receive emails from people seeking accommodation. It's up to
you to call or email those people back and organise the stay.
 
We haven't vetted the people using our site to find housing, nor can
we vouch for them.  It’s critical that you speak with them yourself to
determine whether it’s a good match, and decide whether you feel
comfortable housing them.
 
Your generosity in offering your home is commendable.  However, we strongly
urge you not to accept an arrangement that doesn’t feel right.  If you
connect with an evacuee and you think for whatever reason it’s not a
good match, tell them so.  If appropriate, you can encourage them to
use our website or hotline to submit more requests.
 
Questions you should ask
 
 * Who are they bringing?  
 * How long do they hope to stay?  
 * What are their expectations from you?  
 * What is their background? 
 * Who are they?  
 * Are they smokers? 
 * Do they have any particular allergies?  
 * Do they need disabled or wheelchair access?  
 * What do they think they might do when you can no longer house them?

Once again, thankyou for your generous offer of support.
 
Kind regards,


The OzFloodHelp Team.
