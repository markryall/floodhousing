Your generosity in offering your home is commendable.  But we strongly
urge you not to accept an arrangement that doesn't feel right.  If you
connect with an evacuee and you think for whatever reason itâ€™s not a
good match, tell them so.  If appropriate, you can encourage them to
use our website or hotline to submit more requests.

Thanks,
The GetUp team.
