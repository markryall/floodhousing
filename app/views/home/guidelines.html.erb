<h2>Guidelines for Hosts</h2>

<p>We have not vetted the people using our site to find housing, nor can we vouch for them.  It’s critical that you speak with them to determine whether it’s a good match and decide whether you feel comfortable housing them.</p>

<p>Your generosity in offering your home is commendable.  But we strongly urge you not to accept an arrangement that doesn’t feel right.  If you connect with an evacuee and you think for whatever reason it’s not a good match, tell them so.  If appropriate, you can encourage them to use our website or hotline to submit more requests.</p>

<h3>Questions to ask:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Who are they bringing?</li>
<li>How long do they hope to stay?</li>
<li>What are their expectations from you?</li>
<li>What is their background? Who are they?</li>
<li>Are they smokers? Do they have any particular allergies?</li>
<li>Do they need disabled or wheelchair access?</li>
<li>What do they think they might do when you can no longer house them?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Guidelines for Visitors</h2>

<p>We have not vetted the people using our site to volunteer housing, nor can we vouch for them.  It’s critical that you speak with them to determine whether it’s a good match and decide whether you feel comfortable staying with them.</p>

<p>It’s important that you talk to any potential hosts before making an arrangement to stay with them. Be very clear about your expectations, and ask them about theirs. </p>

<h3>Questions to ask:</h3>
<ul>
<li>How long are they comfortable with you staying?</li>
<li>What are their expectations from you?</li>
<li>What kind of household help can you provide?</li>

</ul>
